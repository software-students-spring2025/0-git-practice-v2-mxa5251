- [An interesting article about what it's really like to be a software engineer](https://hbr.org/2021/07/career-crush-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer)
- One thing that stood out to me was the similarities between me and the subject of the article. Like her, I was also interested in medicine at the start of my college career, but discovered coding by accident when my roommate walked me through his homework one day. The article talks about the relative accessibility of code and while I don't think it's as easy to break into tech these days, I would still agree that with the right mentor, most anyone can make it in. I was inspired by her success at companies like Slack, Lyft, and Stripe and like every CS student, I hope ot follow in her footsteps.

# Comment from Jessica Chen (jessicahc)

I certainly agree that a big misconception is that software engineers only code. Being a software engineer also requires strong teamwork and effective communication, not only within their development teams but also with colleagues across different departments. Working in such collaborative environments provides more opportunities to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures, offering experiences that may be less common in other fields. I think this collaborative aspect is what makes software engineering such a rewarding and enriching experience.
